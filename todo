High priority bugs
------------------
Error logging

Detect errors when login details wrong
 - or other badness in eventsforce interactions?
 - when errors occur during photo uploading that we know are "just retry, EF sucks", retry them

Suppress exception popups when one is already on screen

Lock database so only one can be open

High priority features
----------------------
use pyinstaller instead of py2exe

General feature to allow backup

Fetch recent changes (needs to handle date arguments to report)

Sort display by date of last change, filter by date of last change

Later
-----
EF fetch photos should allow "just this person"

When the application crashes to an exception, shut down worker threads before main application (or else they segfault)

Deduplication reports

Fix abuses of super() by getting rid of them. super() is insane

Purge habitual getters/setters

Multiple simultaneous uploads, for speed? Downloads? Priority of those?
