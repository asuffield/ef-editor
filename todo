High priority bugs
------------------
Suppress exception popups when one is already on screen

Lock database so only one can be open

We need to detect when a person is cancelled. This requires us to know
what event we're working on. Make this a program-global state, rather
than just a filter. Lots of things make more sense that way around.

High priority features
----------------------
use pyinstaller instead of py2exe

Fetch recent changes (needs to handle date arguments to report)

Sort display by date of last change, filter by date of last change

Later
-----
EF fetch photos should allow "just this person"

When the application crashes to an exception, shut down worker threads before main application (or else they segfault)

Deduplication reports

Fix abuses of super() by getting rid of them. super() is insane

Purge habitual getters/setters

Multiple simultaneous uploads, for speed? Downloads? Priority of those?
